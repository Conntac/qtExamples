There are a few methods to change the translation of a QML-based application
dynamically, i.e. at runtime (all of which have their pros and cons). 

You can use a trick with property bindings as shown 
[here](https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_do_dynamic_translation_in_QML)
We tested this with Qt5.9 (which requires a few changes to the code linked 
above).

Another thing you could do is to use a Loader and reload the source element
after translation. This is a minimal, complete and verifiable example of how
to do this.
